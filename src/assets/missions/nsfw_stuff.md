Things that are chill: flirting, big gay makeout sessions, fade-to-black, kinky dynamics, skimpy outfits, tasteful fetish gear, people ERPing outside of gampelay time.

Things that are not chill: Bringing up stuff that should definitely be CWed without asking, more than a few words description of a sex scene, tbh that's mostly it but please don't make me expand this list lmao
