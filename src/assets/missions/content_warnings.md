This campaign revolves around the brutal violence and politics of insurgency against an oppressive regime. That means topics such as violence, injury, death, torture, war crimes, and oppression may be present. I do not intend to get overly graphic, but the bar for that is ultimately subjective so be warned.

Other potentially triggering themes that may come up include: Subjectivity override, hive minds, and manipulative relationship dynamics.

Themes that I do not ever intend to include are: Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, rape, slavery

Please DM me with any questions.
