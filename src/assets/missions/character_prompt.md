# Briefing // #998

## Vibes
I am shooting for a little more narrative/RP action than I see in a lot of lancer games, so please come ready to bring your best Big Gay Drama energy. I have some shit planned, but I am 100% here for player agency, so don't worry too too much about derailing my schemes.

## Scheduling
This campaign will aim for weekly play. If you are interested, please [fill out](https://whenisgood.net/zk35t3d) your availability.

## License Level
License level will be either 0 or 2 depending on player comfort with the system. If you are interested, please DM me with your preferred starting license level.

## Character Prompt
You will be playing as a small band of independent mercenaries operating in the [Dawnline Shore](https://lancer.wiki.gg/wiki/Dawnline_Shore) who have recently been contracted by the Lluvian People's Front, a fractious insurgent group seeking to depose the current [Baronic](https://lancer.wiki.gg/wiki/Karrakin_Trade_Baronies) government. The money is good, but not good enough to justify the danger.

## Why are you here?
Money is a good reason, but not the only reason you decided to take up this job. Whether revolutionary sympathies, a grudge, an inexplicable pull, or something else entirely, you were drawn to it. Why?

## Why are you a mercenary?
The life of a mercenary is not exactly a rational one. With the kind of money just your gear is worth, you could live a peaceful life on a utopian Core World. Unless you're a local, time dialation has separated you from any friends or family by decades. For much of the galaxy, violence is an incredibly distant concept, and the idea of killing utterly revolting, yet you signed up to kill for money. What is wrong with you that led you down this path?

## Who are you outside of work?
Fighting and dying is the kind of thing that tends to dominate one's personality, but the mercenary life does involve quite a bit of downtime. What do you do to while away the long hours shipboard, hunkered down in some grungy FOB, or burning cash waiting for the next job to find you? What goals or dreams do you harbor that have nothing to do with mercenary work?
