## FACTIONS
**[House of Stone](https://lancer.wiki.gg/wiki/House_of_Stone)**

One of the 9 Major Houses of the [Federal Karrakin Monarchy](https://lancer.wiki.gg/wiki/Karrakin_Trade_Baronies#Government), the House of Stone are the current owners of Longmont. A [Hagiographic](https://lancer.wiki.gg/wiki/Hagiography) house, they seek greater independence from the centralized **Karrakin** government and to maintain the purity of **Karrakin** culture, especially from the influence of **Union**.
- **House Losolla** is a Minor House, part of the House of Stone, and are currently the appointed governors of Longmont. The head of the house is **Baron Octethes Losolla**. Recently appointed, they have profited immensely off of the mineral riches of the world.
- **House Brutus** is the only other Minor House with significant holdings on Longmont. The former governors, they were ousted during the [First Interest War](https://lancer.wiki.gg/wiki/First_Interest_War), and, having fallen out of favor, when the planet was ceded back to the House of Stone as part of the peace treaty, only a few token holdings and the city of **Nova Passacaglia** were returned to them. 

**Lluvian People's Front**

From its roots as a trade union, the **LPF** has grown into a sizeable movement, thanks in no small part to backing from some or all of the many organizations with a vested interest in their success. [Harrison Armory](https://lancer.wiki.gg/wiki/Harrison_Armory), [HORUS](https://lancer.wiki.gg/wiki/HORUS), the various [Republican](https://lancer.wiki.gg/wiki/Republicanism) groups of the Baronies, and **Union**'s [DoJ/HR](https://lancer.wiki.gg/wiki/Union#Department_of_Justice_and_Human_Rights) have all been (not unreasonably) accused of supporting the rebels, but as of yet no concrete evidence has been found to support any of those claims. 
The **LPF**'s meteoric growth has not come without its own problems, however. Though there are many people who all agree that the current regime must fall, opinions on what should come after are far less unified. 
- The **Independants** make up the hardline ideological core of the **LPF**. Made up primarily of workers, trade unionists, socialists, and anarchists, they are overrepresented in the frontline forces of the **LPF**. They seek an independent Longmont, free from outside rule.
- The **Reformists** are the most recent addition to the **LPF**. Made up of wealthy ignobles, merchants, and even, it is rumored, covert support from members of **House Brutus**, the reformists seek to place someone more sympathetic on the throne or in some cases abolish the monarchy entirely and join the burgeoning ranks of **Republican** houses, but still wish to remain part of the **Federal Karrakin Monarchy**.
- The **Utopians** are relatively alligned with the independants, but their ultimate goal differs: They want to see Longmont join **Union**, angling to become a utopian post-scarcity **Core World**.
